### API Gateway
Amazon API Gateway is a powerful API management service that allows us to easily create, manage, and deploy APIs to connect our applications to other services and users. In our project, API Gateway helps us build and manage API endpoints to access dynamic data from Lambda and DynamoDB.
### Lambda
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows us to run code without managing servers. We use Lambda in our projects to build small compute functions to handle business logic and access data in DynamoDB. This helps us optimize performance, flexibility and costs.
### DynamoDB
Amazon DynamoDB is a flexible and automatically scalable NoSQL database service. In our project, we use DynamoDB to store dynamic data like chats and messages. With easy scalability and high performance, DynamoDB is ideal for dynamic data storage in our applications.
